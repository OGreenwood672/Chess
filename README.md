# Chess

This was my first attempt at a decently complex Ai.
Although the ai uses the minimax algorithm incorpaarated with alpha beta to improve efficiency, the algorithm can only see 3 moves into the future.

This was probably due to my inefficient programming of the minimax function.

This personnal project is now part of the not great projects of my past, no contribution can improve this mess of code.
